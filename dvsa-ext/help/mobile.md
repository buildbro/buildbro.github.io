# How to use the Booking Assist mobile app

## Step 1: Download the App
Download the app from Google Play Store.

## Step 2: Login to DVSA Website
Open the app and use the Book New (for a new test) or Change Test (to change a test you've already booked) button to login to the the DVSA website.

## Step 3: Get to the Test Centre Results Page
Navigate the DVSA Website till you get to the Test Centre results page.

## Step 4: Search for Your Preferred Centre
Enter the name of your preferred Test Centre (e.g, Chilwell) in the Search box at the bottom of the app. 
Then, press on the blue Search button. Nothing will happen when you press the Search button if no available test is found.

## Step 5: Reload Result Page
Tap on the Blue Refresh button to load more results. 
Then, tap on the blue Search button to see if any new available dates were added to the results.

## Step 6: Repeat Step 4 & 5
Repeat step 4 and 5 till you find a good date. However, do not Refresh the page too fast as this can lead to a temporal ban on the website. I'd say wait at least 100 seconds between each Refresh.
